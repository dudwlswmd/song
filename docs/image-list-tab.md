# Feature Name
Image List Tab

## Purpose
Create a tabbed interface to display different categories of images on the home page using React state hooks. This will allow users to switch between different image collections (e.g., Recent, Popular, Categories) with smooth transitions.

## Requirements
- Implement tab-based navigation for image lists
- Use useState hook to manage active tab state
- Display different image collections based on selected tab
- Follow BEM naming convention for CSS classes
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Smooth transitions between tabs
- Image lazy loading for performance

## API Interfaces
- `GET /api/images/recent` - Fetch recent images
- `GET /api/images/popular` - Fetch popular images  
- `GET /api/images/categories/:category` - Fetch images by category

## UI/UX Notes
- Use tab interface with clear visual indicators for active state
- Grid layout for image display (responsive columns)
- Hover effects on images and tabs
- Loading states while fetching images
- Error handling for failed image loads
- Image preview modal on click

## Edge Cases
- Empty image lists
- Network timeout during image fetch
- Broken image URLs
- Very large image files
- Mobile touch interactions
- Browser compatibility for image formats
