Rule: rull-class-structure.react

Description

This rule defines consistent structure and behavior for React components using BEM-style class naming and tab UI managed by simple hooks. It ensures components are readable, modular, and easily maintainable by AI and developers.

Always
	•	Use meaningful component names like Main, RullClass, and RullHook to separate concerns.
	•	Follow BEM naming convention strictly: block__element__subelement.
	•	Use useState to manage the active tab index.
	•	Change tab UI by updating activeTab state.
	•	Add the active class to the currently selected tab for styling.

Example

const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(1);

<div
  className={`rullClass__inner__content__item ${activeTab === 1 ? 'active' : ''}`}
  onClick={() => setActiveTab(1)}
>
  Tab Example 1
</div>

Anti-Pattern
	•	Not using BEM for class names.
	•	Creating tabs without state management (e.g., hardcoded styles).
	•	Complex conditional logic or deeply nested hooks for simple UI behaviors.

Objective (AI-friendly language)

Make React components easy to understand:
	•	Use clear structure (sections, articles, divs)
	•	Keep logic simple (one state for tabs)
	•	Follow naming rules (BEM-style) so AI knows what each class means
	•	Don’t use tricky logic or unusual patterns

By following this rule, both humans and AI can read, fix, or extend your components faster and with fewer bugs.
